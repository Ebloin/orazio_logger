      <H2>What to tune in the kinematics?</H2>
      Here we will tell our robot how big it is and how large its wheel are.
      We will also adjust the acceleration ramps to tradeoff battery-consumption,
      reactivity and smoothness.

      Normally we would like to control our robot in standard units,
      with translational velocities expressed as meters per second,
      and rotational velocities expressed in radiants per second.  So
      far our universe consists of encoder ticks and PWM values.
      Still the system internally has to deal with these quantities,
      but we want to expose a more abstract interface.  To this extent
      we need to relate meters and seconds to encoder ticks (that
      seems to be the universal measure in our little firmware world,
      like king's arm for measuring the distances).

      At the end of this section we will be able to impose to the base
      velocities in standard units.

      <H3> Motor indices and sign of kr/kl </H3> 
      The first step is to fugure out what is the left and the right motor in the platform.
      We have two motors, so two joints 0 and 1. To discover what is right motor, turn
      the right wheel <i> forward </i> with your hand. you will see one of the encoder counts changing
      in the Joint Status box on the top. That motor is the right one.
      <b> If the encoder count grows when you turn the wheel, you might expect a positive <i>kr</i>,
      otherwise a negative value </b>.
      Enter in the caption <i> right motor index </i> the number of the right joint. <br/>

      Repeat the procedure for the left joint, and update the <i> left
      motor index </i>.  You have just assigned the motors.  The same
      considerations we made for <i>kr</i> hold for <i>kl</i>.  Save
      the parameters on the eeprom.<br/>

      Assign a nominal value to <i>kr</i> and <i>kl</i> (e.g. 1e-5),
      respecting the signs you have found before.  Thus, if you have
      found a positive <i>kr</i> and a negative <i>kl</i>,
      enter <i>1e-5</i> in the <i>kr</i> caption and
      <i>-1e-5</i> in the <i>kl</i> caption.

      To see if the things work all right, enter in the caption "base velocities" 
      <ul>
	<li>
	  enter 1 to <i>translational_velocity</i> and 0 to <i>rotational_velocity</i>, the wheels should both move forward. 
	</li>
	<li>
	  enter -1 to <i>translational_velocity</i> and 0 to <i>rotational_velocity</i>, the wheels should both move backwards. 
	</li>
	<li>
	  enter 0 to <i>translational_velocity</i> and 1 to <i>rotational_velocity</i>, the wheels should move as if the platform turns right. 
	</li>
	<li>
	  enter 0 to <i>translational_velocity</i> and -1 to <i>rotational_velocity</i>, the wheels should move as if the platform turns left. 
	</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    If the above test does not work, you probably have made a mistake.

    <p>
      <H3> Baseline </H3>
      Take a meter and measure the distance between the wheel. This is the baseline.
      Enter the value (in meters) in the caption <i>baseline</i>
      Save on eeprom.
    </p>

    <p>
      <H3> Kr/KL and Baseline </H3>
      <i>kr</i> and  <i>kl</i> are the conversion coefficients telling how many meters a wheel moves forward,
      when the encoder measures the motion of one tick. These values are expressed in meters per tick.
      You might find more convenient to measure the ticks per meter, and some calibration tools report
      numbers such as the forward motion per appearant wheel diameter. <br/>
      It is for this reason that you can enter this parameter in three possible ways, but remember,
      it represent the same entity. The only value inside the firmware is kr/kl in meters per tick,
      and this is the value displayed in the kinematics parameters status box on the top of the window.

      To give an initial value to kr/kl proceed as follows:
      <ul>
	<li> go to the <a href="orazio_joystick.html?joystick" target="_parent"> Joystick </a> and connect a joy</li>
	<li> move the left stick forward and backward and see if you can control the translational velocity</li>
	<li> move the right stick left and right and see if you can control the rotational velocity</li>
	<li> reset the platform (press the reset key on the arduino), this should zero the encoder counts. Alternatively,
	save all parameters so far in eeprom, shut down the websocket server and disconnect the arduino from the usb. This does a reset.</li>
	<li> connect arduino and restart the websocket server </li>
	<li> refresh this page </li>
	<li> the encoder_position field of the joints should be zero for both joints </li>
	<li> take a meter and measure 1 meter on the ground, in front of the robot </li>
	<li> with the joystick, move the robot to travel 1 meter, the encoder position will increase/decrease as you move. <b>Consider only the joint with increasing value </b> </li>
	<li> after 1 meter, write down the number <i> encoder position </i>. If the encoder has a high resolution the number might wrap around. You will have to select a shorter
	distance for calibrating, let's say 10 cm</li>
	<li> the "nominal" values of kl/kr is the distance in meters you choose for calibrarion divided by the encoder_position. Instead of making the division,
	  if you move for 1 meter, you can enter the value encoder_position in <i>ikr</i> and <i>ikl</i>, that stand for inverse kl and inverse kr.
	  Thus, assuming you move 1 meter, the right joint is the joint 0 with positive kr, the left joint is joint 1 and has a negative kl (thus was decreasing).
	  You consider the encoder_position of the increasing joint (in this case joint 0). Let us assume that the value of encoder_position of the joint 0 is 30000.
	  To calibrate the ticks you enter 30000 in <i>ikr</i> and -30000 <i>ikl</i> (remember the signs?). Save on eeprom.  
      </ul>
      Congratulations, you made your first rude odometry calibration. To check if it makes sense, connect the joystick, reset the platform and move for 1 meter in front.
      The <i>x</i> field of the kinematics status should be roughly 1.
      Turn 90  degrees counterclockwise. The <i>theta</i> field should be around 1.57.

      <H3> Velocities and Accelerations </H3>
      The last step is to configure your platform by limiting the speeds and the acceleration ramps. The nominal values are usually ok.
      Setting to low acceleration ramps too low might result in the platform not moving at all. Thus for these tests set the accelerations
      to rather high values.
