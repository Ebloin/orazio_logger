    <H1>What to tune in the joints?</H2>
      Here you will connect the encoders, veryfy the H bridge and check that all connections are properly made.
      The process is incremental, you will check the things one at a time while doing them. If you make some mistake
      the probablity that you damage some hardware is rather small.
    </p>
    <p>
      <H3> Connecting and checking the encoders </H3>
      You need to connect the encoders to arduino and verify if they are correctly sensed.
      Here are the connections:
      <ul>
       Power (for both motors)
       <ul>
         <li> power (+5v), is the <b>blue</b> wire on the motors. It can go to any of the +5v outputs of the arduino. </li>
         <li> GND, is the <b> green </b>  wire on the motors. It can go to any of the GND outputs of the arduino. </li>
       </ul>
       <li> right motor </li> 
       <ul>
         <li> phase_a, is the <b>yellow</b> wire, on pin 50 of arduino. </li>
         <li> phase_b, is the <b>white</b> wire, on pin 51 of arduino </li>
       </ul>
       <li> left motor </li> 
       <ul>
         <li> phase_a, is the <b>yellow</b> wire, on pin 52 of arduino. </li>
         <li> phase_b, is the <b>white</b> wire, on pin 53 of arduino </li>
       </ul>
     </ul>

     Once you have done the above connection you can check if it works by manually rotating the wheels.
     If you go on the <a href="orazio_joints.html?joints" target="_parent"> Joints </a> page you should be able
     to see the numbers in the field <i>encoder_position</i> changing when you rotate the wheel.
     They should increase when you rotate in one direction and decrease when you rotate in the other.<br/>
     If this is not the case, you made something wrong with the connections. Check them again,
     and connect the motors one at a time.

   </p>

    <b>IMPORTANT</b><br/>
    Set the correct motor mode before connecting the H Bridge,
    and save the parameter to the eeprom.

   <p>

     <H3> Connecting and checking the H bridge </H3>
     Done with the encoders? It is now time to connect the H bridge.
     There are three most common types of H bridges, each one has a different way to be controlled.
     The current firmware on megag560 supports these three types:
    <ul>
      <li><b>PWM and DIR (h_bridge_type=0)</b>:
        <ul>
          <li>pin 0: PWM is an analog output, encodes magnitude of the speed, the higher the value the faster the motor will spin)</li>
          <li>pin 1: DIR is a digital output. encodes the sign of the speed (_5V, negative, 0V positive)
          <li>pin 2: Brake is a digital pin, when set to 1 it sets the bridge in brake mode.
                     If not used assign it to some unused pin in the board in the range 1-13.
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>DUAL PWM (h_bridge_type=1)</b>:
        these bridges use two wires that are mutually exclusive and control two directions of rotation. To get the motor rotating in a direction, they issue the PWM on the corresponding pin and leave the other one to 0.
        <ul>
          <li>pin 0: PWM for forward direction, is an analog output</li>
          <li>pin 1: PWM for backward direction, is an analog output</li>
          <li>pin 2: unused</li>
        </ul>        
        The <b>red L298N board</b> suggested in MARRtino web site uses this mode.  
      </li>
      <li><b>Half Cycle PWM(h_bridge_type=2)</b>: please check the datasheet of the bridge to figure out how to connect the pins.
        these bridges use a single wire to encode the both speed and direction of the motor. A 50% of duty cycle means the motor is still,
        a 100% means the motor moves forward at maximum speed, a 0% means the motor will move backwards at maximum speed
        <ul>
          <li>pin 0: PWM for forward/backward direction, is an analog output</li>
          <li>pin 2: enable, when at logical 1 the ridge is powered (optional). Is a digital pin</li>
        </ul>        
      </li>
    </ul>
    After setting the pins according to the specs of your board you can safely to connect the H bridge.

    After connecting the H bridge, but without connecting the motors, you can check
    if everything is right using a tester. <br/>
    To this end, power the H bridge by connecting the battery in to a 12V source. <br\>
    In this stage, it is convenient to disable the watchdog, by setting to 0 the watchdog_cycles in 
    <a href="orazio_system.html?system" target="_parent"> System </a>.
    In this way the control we send to the board will be executed forever and we have more
    time for debugging. <br/>
    With a tester at hand measure the voltage in the motor outputs of the bridge.<br/>

    Joints have 3 working mode as show in following table. <br/><br/>

    <table align="center" border="3">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top" align="center" width="110"><b>JOINT MODE</b></td>
          <td valign="top" align="center" width="30"> <b>ID</b> </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top" align="center">Joint Disabld</td>
          <td valign="top" align="center">0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top" align="center">PWM</td>
          <td valign="top" align="center">1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

          <td valign="top" align="center">2</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table><br/>

    For each joint separately, set the joint mode to 1 and issue a speed of 255 in the speed caption, and measure the voltage. You should
    get a high value. Be sure you are measuring the correct output. you have 2 motors.
    Do the same for with a negative value of -255, and check the voltage. You should a number having an opposite sign
    w.r.t before (you are giving a negative voltage after all). Check if the outputs are consistent.<br/>
    Finally, click the STOP button.<br/>

    If this does not work, you might have made a mistake. 
    Check the wires and the pins again, and be sure the H bridge is
    of the correct type.
  </p>

  <p>
   <H3> Connecting the motors </H3>
   Ok, the bridge is working, time to see the wheels moving. Connect
   the motors to the output channels of the bridge.  Here are the
   connections for our two types of H bridge:
   <ul>
     <li>Arduino Motor Board
      <ul>
        <li>Motor shield out - motors (red + /black -) </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>L298N
      <ul>
        <li>L298N Out1 - Left Motor black</li>
        <li>L298N Out2 - Left Motor red</li>
        <li>L298N Out3 - Right Motor black</li>
        <li>L298N Out4 - Right Motor red</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    Here you can basically make the following mistakes:
    <ul>
     <li>swapping the motors</li>
     <li>inverting the motor polarity</li>
   </ul>
   None of the above mistakes is destructive, and they can be easily
   fixed.<br/>
   With the motors connected, set <i>joints[0].mode</i> to 1 and issue a 100 in the <i>joints[0].speed</i> box
   of the <a href="orazio_joints.html?joints" target="_parent">
   Joints</a> page.
   You should see one of the motors <b>slowly</b> running in one direction.
   Check that the <i>encoder_position</i> of the joint 0 is changing.
   If this not the case you swapped the motors, and you have to swap the
   left and the right motor.<br/>

   If motor velocity is high and does not depend on the PWM command value,
   check that the number reported in "desired_speed" for that joint has 
   the same sign of the PWM command you issue. 
   For example, 100 on the joint 0 should result in a positive desired speed, while
   -100 should result in a negative one.  If this is not the
   case, check connections and swap either the encoders connection or 
   the polarity of the motor on the H bridge. <br/>

   Repeat the test for the other motor, issuing 100 and -100 in the <i>joints[1].speed</i> field, setting also the <i>joints[1].mode</i> to 1.
   Once all is working you can go to the next step. <br/>
 </p>


 <p>
   <H3> Open Loop Tuning </H3>
   Another parameter that is relevant for controlling a motor is the "detach current".
   Motors require a minimum voltage to rotate. If you issue a voltage below that level,
   the motor will not move and consime power anyway. We don't like this.
   So we need to find the minimum voltage (that in our case is the PWM value) to
   issue to the motor and expect a movement.
   To find this value for each motor individually, start incrementing the pwm command
   from "0" to "N" in steps of 10. The <i>pwm_min</i> value is the minimum value for which the motor
   moves.
   Save this value as "pwm_min" in the corresponding joint parameter.
   For "pwm_max" you can leave the default value.
 </p>

 <p>
  <H3> PID tuning </H3>
  The motors are controlled in closed loop, and they get the feedback from the encoder.
  This means during normal operation,  you tell the encoder a speed expressed as
  ticks per cycle, and the controller will adjust the PWM to match that
  value.
  Normally the parameters of the PID in the default configuration are adequate.
  For a better tuning you can just follow a  PID tuning tutorial on the web.<br/>

  Still you can check that the PID does a decent job.
  Enable the PID controller with <i>joints[0].mode</i> equals to 2 and issue a 10 to on the <i>joints[0].speed</i>. You should see
  the "desired_speed" in the status_box, and the "encoder_speed" reaching similar values.
  Try to brake the motor, and you will see that the controller will increase the PWM
  to keep the speed at a desired level.

  Do the same with the other motor,
  You are done with the joints.

<H2>If you reach this step, and all goes well, save the parameters on the EEPROM. Press the button on the bottom of the Joints page.</H2>
